# AWS-DeepRacer-Project

AWS DeepRacer is the fastest way to get rolling with reinforcement learning (RL), literally, with a fully autonomous 1/18th scale race car driven by reinforcement learning, 3D racing simulator, and a global racing league. Developers can train, evaluate, and tune RL models in the online simulator, deploy their models onto AWS DeepRacer for a real-world autonomous experience and compete in the AWS DeepRacer League for a chance to win the AWS DeepRacer Championship Cup.

# Why did I get myself into this?

I received a message from Udemy about receiving a scholarship from Amazon to learn A.I. and M.L., so I saw a perfect opportunity to improve my skills on a project that I can see results right away, with a pretty cool goal.

In order to receive the scholarship, you need to pass a quiz and train your model to complete a track in 3 minutes or less. Even  :)f I don't get it, it's pretty cool to see that I managed to even show up on the leaderboard :)
